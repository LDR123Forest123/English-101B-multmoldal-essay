    <h1>Writing Processes</h1>
    <body>
<pre>   Many writing styles have different parts that follow the english language standard.
   My personal process involves more than just the mechanics.
   All of these differnces can be highlighted in the history
   of how I was taught how to write.
   In my essay about my own writing style I show how I have grown
   every year since elementary school. In high school the teacher
   who fostered my growth was Mrs Wendy Tamminga.
   My own style of writing became stronger as I started
   school at Central Washington University.
   Writing styles change based on the
   overall environment.
