        <h1><pse>Every person who is a writer has different styles.
             The people who influences my own personal Writing
             style are Mrs Tamminga from my high school and
             Professor Melissa Brouwer at CWU. Both of these
             teachers have given me differnet tools to use
             which make my writing stronger.

<h2><pse>
    When I write there has to be either complete quiet or some form of music.
    This helps me to be more efficant with my writing in every situtation.
    Most of my writing is usually academic but I have always enjoyed writing for pleasure.
